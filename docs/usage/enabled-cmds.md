![The Synchronize Command](../assets/img/enabled-cmds.png)
{: refdef}

The Problem: the
[**Sync with Drive**](sync) command is directly adjacent to the 
[**Upload to Drive**](upload)
command on the plugin menu, and an accidental slip of the mouse might end in a minor catastrophe.

To help avoid that hazard, you can enable the commands you use most, and 
disable those you don't.  

## What Happens
* Commands that are checked are enabled on the plugin menu; unchecked 
commands are disabled.
* Disabling the [**Sync with Drive**](sync) command also disables any enabled
[auto-sync](autosync) options.

## How it Works
* Click [**Configuration**](../install/config#configuration-window) on the
plugin menu to open the dialog, then the
[**Options and Defaults** tab](../install/config#options-and-defaults)
shown above.
* Select the commands to be disabled/enabled.
* Initially, you must explicitly disable commands.  The first time the plugin
is installed, all commands are enabled.
* At least one command must be enabled.
